I decided to use 0.001 for a learning rate, as both the Character Level LSTM project and the Sentiment Analysis example use this learning rate. For my embedding dimension and my hidden dimension, I used 400 and 256 like the Sentiment Analysis example.  (The Sentiment Analysis says that common values for the hidden dimension are 128, 256, 512).  I am using 2 hidden layers like these two examples do (in between recommended 1 -3).  I am going with a lower sequence_length (12), which I decided on from tips from others in the help section as to how they got their models to converge more quickly.  I also decided to eliminate the additional dropout layer that I had in my model, since others said that dropout is already included in the LSTM and they had better results without it."
